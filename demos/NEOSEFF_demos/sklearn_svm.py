# Support Vector Machines are a very common machine learning algorithm. An SVM attempts to find the best separating
# hyperplane (since an SVM works in multidimensional, it is a hyperplane, in 2d space this would be just a line).
# An SVM is binary, meaning that it can only classify data into 2 sets at a time. This doesn't mean that an SVM can't
# classify data into more than 2 categories, it just means it only categorizes into 2 categories at a time.

# it is -.
# Vectors have both magnitude and direction. Vectors are represented like this:
# ->
# A  = [3, 4] represents a vector going from [0, 0] to [3, 4]. Its magnitude is calculated like its length (or norm as
# it is called in linear algebra):
# ||A|| = sqrt((3 ^ 2) + (4 ^ 2))
# Multiplying vectors is done with the dot (·) operator and it results in a scalar (regular number), or a vector with
# just magnitude
# ->           ->
# B = [1, 3]   C = [4, 2]
# ->  ->
# A · B = (1 * 4) + (3 * 2) = 10
# Once the SVM has been trained, how does it classify something? This is done through support vector assertion (see
# Support Vector Assertion.png). A vector W is a vector perpendicular to the separating hyperplane. When the SVM goes to
# classify a point, it makes a vector U to that point and then projects U onto W and calculates, accounting for the
# bias, whether U "goes past" the separating hyperplane (+) or "stays behind" it (-). This is calculated by this
# formula:
# U · W + b
# If this is > 0 then it is positive, if it = 0 then it on the decision boundary, and if it is < 0 then it is negative.
# However, the SVM still has to calculate W and b. Math tells us that if point X is in the positive SV domain then
# the equation = 1 and if X is in the negative SV domain then the equation = -1. This means:
# X(+) · W + b = 1
# X(-) · W + b = -1
# The SVM can introduce variable y sub i (denoted yi), which is dependant on the class of X. This means when X is in
# the positive SV domain yi = 1 and when X is in the negative SV domain, yi = -1
# Going back to the previous equations, the SVM can now use yi to manipulate the equations:
# X(+) · W + b = 1      yi = 1
# X(-) · W + b = -1     yi = -1
# Multiplying both sides by yi:
# yi(X(+) · W + b) = 1 * 1 = 1
# yi(X(-) · W + b) = -1 * -1 = 1
# Subtracting 1 from both sides to make the right hand = 0:
# yi(X · W + b) - 1 = 0
# And this is the equation that the SVM uses to classify Xs. However, this equation doesn't define a support vector,
# but for a SVM to be good its support vectors must satisfy this equation. A support vector is simply a vector that,
# if moved, would change the best separating hyperplane.
